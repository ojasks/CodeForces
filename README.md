Welcome to my **Codeforces Problem Solving Repository** – a collection of my solutions to problems from Codeforces contests and practice sets.  
This repo is where I document my Codeforces journey — every contest problem I solve, with code and explanations. It’s not just about storing solutions, it’s about breaking down thought processes, learning new tricks, and steadily leveling up in competitive programming. 

📌 You can also follow my progress on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/<ojaskrsingh24>).

## 📂 What’s Inside  

- ✅ **Contest Solutions** – My submissions from Codeforces rounds (Div. 2, Div. 3, etc.).  
- ✅ **Practice Problems** – Additional problems solved while practicing.  
- ✅ **Explanations** – Each solution is accompanied by a short explanation of the thought process and approach.  
- ✅ **C++ Implementations** – Mostly solved using C++ (with focus on clean and optimized code).

## 🎯 Goals  

- Sharpen algorithmic thinking & problem-solving skills.  
- Improve speed and accuracy for contests.  
- Build a reference base for revising standard problem types.  
- Share approaches for anyone learning competitive programming.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Language**: C++ (C++17/20 with STL)  
- **Platform**: [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)  
- **Tools**: GNU G++ compiler, VS Code

## 🚀 Usage  

If you’re also preparing for contests, you can:  

1. Browse through the problems.  
2. Read the explanations to understand different approaches.  
3. Use the repo as a reference for standard patterns (greedy, DP, graphs, etc.).

## 💡 Note  

This repo is **not a solution bank to copy from**.  
It’s a **learning resource** where I explain how I approached and solved each problem.  
Feel free to use it for **learning, revising, and improving your own problem-solving skills**.
